1) Access scenarios from : https://gis.wim.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/FIMMapper

2) Download arcgis shape files for the required scenarios

3) In QGIS use the boundary shapefile to download the corresponding open street map

4) Add inundation layer on top of OSM and calculate the intersection between the two layers

5) Extract the link names from the dbf created from the intersection. TODO: Automate link extraction

6) Save the inundation levels in text files

7) Sumo Simulation Algorithm:
	1) While all vehicles have not exited the simulation
		- Simulate step
		- if warning time has passed
			Run evacuation strategy
		- else
			Run normal traffic

		- if flood event has started
			Close inundated links


Simulation matrix:

Time of Day :	Peak		Off Peak		Night
Time of Evac:	12 hours	6 hours			2 hours
Evac Priority:	Low lying 1st	Farthest from staging	Closest to Hazard
Topolgy:	Oneway -> 2 way	Oneway towards dest.	Base case
Decision:	Evac Rate	# of people evac	Lives saved	Clearance time


Evacuation Strategy:
Departure time modeling	 = Decision time delay + Preperation time delay
Descision time delay	 = Constant based on warning time
Preperation time	 = Random variable based on some distribution (Rayliegh)
